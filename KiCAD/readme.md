# KiCAD files
There are two versions of the PCB for designs with either a 48- or 64-pin MSP430 microcontroller. Both the schematic and layout KiCAD files use some custom components. These are probably already available online somewhere, but I decided to make my own 
footprints following the manufacturer data sheets to reduce the risk of fabrication problems.

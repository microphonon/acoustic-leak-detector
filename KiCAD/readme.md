# KiCAD and Gerber files
Both the schematic and layout KiCAD files use some custom components. These are probably already available online somewhere, but I decided to make my own 
footprints following the manufacturer data sheets to reduce the risk of fabrication problems. Everything in this repo has been built, tested, and found 
to work OK. The complete set of gerber files is also included.
